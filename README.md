# Bible Copyrights

This repository was created to house the copyright notices for major English Bible translations in one place for educational purposes. 

My aim is to facilitate translation choice for those who wish to quote the Bible and remain in good standing under United States and international copyright law. As always, note I am not a lawyer, and nothing in this repository should be considered as legal advice.

## Public domain editions of the Bible

Several older translations of the Bible are public domain. The text of the following translations is available here: https://github.com/scrollmapper/bible_databases

* American Standard-ASV1901 (ASV)
* Bible in Basic English (BBE)
* Darby English Bible (DARBY)
* King James Version (KJV)
* Webster's Bible (WBT)
* World English Bible (WEB)
* Young's Literal Translation (YLT)

## Further reading

The copyright status of the King James Version is unique. It is effectively public domain outside of the United Kingdom. Within the UK, [the rights are held by the Crown under Royal prerogative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_James_Version#Copyright_status), and Cambridge University Press is authorized as Queen's Printer through [Letters patent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letters_patent). I include the Cambridge University Press copyright notice here for reference to those interested.
