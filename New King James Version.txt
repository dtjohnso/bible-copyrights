## How do I get permission to quote from the NKJV, NCV, ICB, The Voice, or The Expanded Bible translation?

**Bible Quotation Policy:**

The below applies to all Thomas Nelson Bible translations: New King
James Version (NKJV), New Century Version (NCV), International
Children's Bible (ICB), Expanded Bible, or The Voice.

If your use of Scripture does not fall within all the Gratis Use
Guidelines listed below, written permission is required, and you will
need to submit a formal request.

 

**Gratis Use Guidelines:**

-   No more than 500 verses quoted in total.
-   Scripture does not make up more than 25% of the total text.
-   Scripture does not account for an entire book of the Bible.
-   Scripture is not quoted in a commentary or any other Biblical
    Reference work.
-   All Scripture must be properly cited (see below).
-   Your product is not listed below in the "Not Covered by Gratis Use"
    section.

Scripture from any of the Thomas Nelson translations may be quoted in
any form (written, visual, electronic, or audio) up to five hundred
(500) verses or less without written permission, provided Scripture does
not make up more than 25% of the total text in the work and the
Scripture is not being quoted in commentary or another Biblical
reference work. If an entire book of the Bible is being reproduced,
regardless of verse count, written permission is required. This
permission is contingent upon an appropriate copyright acknowledgment.

**Not covered by Gratis Use:**

-   Scripture on a product in which the verse stands alone such as
    artwork, notecards, crafts, novelty products, jewelry.
